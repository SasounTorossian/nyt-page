# nyt-page
New York Times article page replica based off the Odin project curriculum. Live demo can be found on github.io [here](https://sasountorossian.github.io/nyt-page/).

Project was very simple and did not really challenge me in many ways. Tried to make greater use of list elements (ul and li) instead of just using divs everywhere. 
Also made greater use of a wide range of html tags such as figure, article, section, etc.
